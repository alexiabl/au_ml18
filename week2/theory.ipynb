    "# Theoretical Exercises week 2\n",
    "**Like last week, it is very imporant that you try to solve every exercise. It is not important that you answer correctly. Spend no more than 5-10 min on each exercise. If you do not solve the exercise, focus on understanding the question, and try to figure out what it is you do not understand.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The TA's will be very happy to answer questions during the TA session or on the board.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might want to spend a bit more than 10 min on 5, 6 and 8, they are substantially harder than the rest of the exercises. Question 8 is mainly for the interested student with time left over. Do not despair if you cannot solve them, but try to understand the question and pinpoint which parts you do not understand. \n",

    "## A shorty story about Ben \n",
    "Ben is a student at Aarhus University. Like all other university students Ben has to learn a lot of different stuff. Ben is taking a class called '5 ECTS ON BIRDS' where he has to learn two things\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. During the course, the lecturer gave Ben a photo album with images of different birds and their name. Ben needs to learn the names of all the birds. At the exam, Ben will be given several images for which he needs to name the birds.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "   2. During the course, the lecturer gave Ben several recordings of birds singing. For this task the lecturer doesn't care about names. At the exam, Ben will be given recordings he needs to seperate into two groups based on how similar they sound.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Ben notices one significant difference between the two tasks. In the first, his supervisor gave him the correct answer for each image. This is called *supervised learning* because the supervisor provides a correct answer. In the second task, his supervisor did not give him a correct answer. Instead, Ben had to group the audio samples based on similarity. This is called *unsupervised learning*, because there is not supervision in terms of correct answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you must distinguish between Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning. Imagine you work at a company that sells *stuff*. The company stores a lot of information on its costumers. For each costumer the company saves the following 5 attributes:\n",

    "# 2. Regression Or Classification\n",
    "## The short story of Ben continues\n",
    "After passing the exam in '5 ECTS ON BIRDS' Ben goes on to take the prestigious '5 ECTS ON ADVANCED BIRDS'. In this class, Ben has to do the following two things\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. He is given a photo album with images of birds and the family they belong to. At the exam, Ben will get images of birds and asked to tell which bird family they belong to. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   2. He is given a photo album with images of birds and how much they cost. At the exam, Ben will get images of birds and be asked to tell how much the bird would cost to buy. \n",
    "    \n",
    "First of, Ben notices that the two tasks are supervised learning; he gets examples with correct answers. Ben also notices a significant difference between the two tasks. In the first, he has to assign each bird to a class. This is called *classification*. In the second task, he has to assign a real number to each bird. This is called *regression*. The difference is essentially that in regression it makes to estimate a value close to the actual value, while in classification you are either right or wrong and close to right is not really meaningfull.\n",
