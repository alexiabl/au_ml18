    "$$P(f(x)=1\\mid x) = P(f(x) =1) = 0.2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "I.e. the probability that $f(x)=1$ is independent of $x$. You can think of this as follows: when $f$ is evaluated it ignores the input and flips its private biased coin independently and returns the result. \n",

    "<b>a)</b> What is the best out-of-sample error we can achieve? \n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: Consider $h(x)=1$ and $h(x)=0$. Would a randomized function be better? E.g. $h(x)=\\begin{cases}\n",

    "0\\quad\\text{with probability } 0.8\n",
    "\\end{cases}$\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>b)</b> What if $P(f(x)=1) =0.5$? \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>c)</b> What are the optimal classifiers for these two cases?\n",
